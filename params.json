Basically, anyone is able to contribute to the project!\r\n\r\n### User friendly and quick\r\nYou don't need any extensive knowledge of Steam's API to use this extension! A feature-extensive GUI with a developer console included gives you the most flexibility. \r\n\r\n### Safe and Secure\r\nThe extension doesn't store any of your trade data, and directly communicates with steam's developer API. The extension works inside the boundaries of steam, giving you an easier and secure way to access trade information without complexity.\r\n\r\n### Donate\r\nThis extension is a non-profit project of mine I've worked on in my free time. To support future updates and projects I appreciate all donations.\r\n\r\nMy BTC Address: 1XCPdWb6kk7PGfvbdRbRuNh51aPc4vqC7\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
